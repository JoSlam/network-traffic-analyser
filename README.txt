Course: COMP 6104
Assessment 1

This network traffic analyser was a product of my own work for this assessment submission

The project was built in python and has dependencies on the following python libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib


Instructions for use:
1. The program uses a network trace converted to csv
2. The exported csv file must contain the Destination port and Source port columns
3. Install the program requirements using the command in the root folder: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the command python ./main.py
5. View console for stat outputs
6. Graphs are displayed in a separate window one by one.
    i.e. When the first graph is closed, the next will follow and so on.
7. Graphs are additionally saved to the figures folder in the root for viewing after running the program
